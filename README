NAME
    Perl::Editor - The Perl Refactoring Editor API

DESCRIPTION
    With the creation of PPI it became possible to do parsing, refactoring,
    and other tasks to Perl source code. Rather than requiring each editor
    to reimplement every single task all over again, they can instead
    implement an interface to "Perl::Editor".

    "Perl::Editor" is intended to provide a single API that will allow
    editor-related functions to be written once, as a "Perl::Editor::Plugin"
    class, and then be installed and used with any editor that acts as a
    "Perl::Editor" host.

    It is also intended to make it much easier to let you write your own
    editor plugins, and then use it with whatever your favourite editor
    happens to be!

STATUS
    This version is intended as a statement of intent (and to lock off the
    namespace. It's mine dammit! MINE!!!)

    However, work is underway on a demonstration editor and commands, based
    on the Proton CE editor.

    A demonstration will be released at OSCON and available online shortly
    after.

WRITING A PLUGIN
    We'll get back to you on that.

MAKING YOUR EDITOR COMPATIBLE
    Yeah, that too. :)

TO DO
    Pretty much everything. Stay tuned.
